## Examples

### Security

Learn how to implement simple authentication using oauth2's password flow.

- [See code ...](./security/)

Let's press the Authorize button.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

You can configure it in your FastAPI application using the CORSMiddleware.

- [See code ...](./cors/)

Starting the server:

```shell
uv run fastapi dev ./scripts/tutorials/security/main.py
```

Starting the server:

```shell
uv run fastapi dev ./scripts/tutorials/cors/main.py
```

CORS request from client:

```shell
curl -v http://localhost:8000/ -H "Origin:https://localhost.tiangolo.com"
```

```console
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*
> Origin:https://localhost.tiangolo.com
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< date: Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:57:22 GMT
< server: uvicorn
< content-length: 25
< content-type: application/json
< access-control-allow-credentials: true
< access-control-allow-origin: https://localhost.tiangolo.com
< vary: Origin
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

If the `access-control-allow-origin` header is present in the response, the request is successful (allowed).

### Bigger Applications - Multiple Files

In a real application, you would need to implement quite a few APIs, so creating them in a single file would be impractical.

This is the equivalent of Flask's Blueprints.

- [See code ...](./app/)

For examples:

```shell
uv run fastapi dev ./scripts/tutorials/app/main.py
```
